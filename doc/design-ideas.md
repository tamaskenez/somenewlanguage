## Goals

- Concise syntax, appealing even for a scientist (as opposed to a programmer or PL researcher)
- Provide control and access to low-level details, predictable assembly output, no magic abstractions between language and hardware (OS or game development)
- Restrictive core language (pure, safe), powerful features are easily accessible but explicit
- Tunable, explicit safety guarantees
- Easy and complete C interop
- The core language must protect its abstractions. Explicit escape hatches may be provided.
- No undefined behaviour, at least not implicitly.
- Code should reasonably hint at what is going to happen when executed (no implicit surprising or costly operations).

## Non-goals

- C-like syntax and other populist design choices
- Open-world compilation model. (But, on explicit request, we should be able to generate functions having a fixed ABI and nothing else).
- Full Hindley-Milner (bidirectional) type inference. Reason: better error messages, simpler and faster compiler.

## Features and other languages

This table has many errors because I don't know those languages. Anyway, this is meant to be a rationale why not to use those languages and start fiddling with my own.

## Function parameters

- No variable-sized argument list: use a list parameter instead.
- No overloading with different number of arguments: for omitting parameters to leave them at their default values, use optional named parameters.

- Fixed number of mandatory positional arguments (at the core it's single arg + currying).
- Mandatory and optional named parameters after the positional parameters.

Functions can be called with or without parens (`sin x`, `sin(x)`).

How named arguments translate to the single-arg functional model?
The problem is:

    foo = λa b $c(=2) -> d = ... // c is optional, named

Then the type of `foo 2 3` is ambiguous.
Possible solution: When providing named parameters one must use the special () function-call syntax. It passes all named parameters to a base function in a single tuple-dict, which base function is then curried with the positional parameters.

    foo_base :: named_pars_tuple_dict -> a -> b -> d

but we must keep

    foo :: a -> b -> d

So probably it's even better not to list named parameters in the main signature of a function:

    foo = λa b -> d = {
        named_arg c = 2
        ...
    }

which desugars to:

    foo_base = λa b named_args -> d = {
        c = named_args.c
        ...
    }

    foo = λa b -> d = foo_base [] a b

Not sure about this.

## Functional composition:

This works in Haskell:

    let twice f x = f(f(x)) in twice(twice)(twice)(twice)(succ)(0)

I mean, the nice thing is that `twice` is easily implementable. Maybe we need this expressive power.
[Here](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/higher-order-functions-twice/5896/4) they discuss how cumbersome is it to do the same in Rust. Can we do it like in Haskell?

    twice f x = f $ f x
    twice f x :: (X -> X) -> X -> X

## Error handling

Don't support any scheme aiming to 'recover' from failures. It's either an unrecoverable failure or business as usual:

- Handling unrecovarable failures should look like when an Erlang process dies. The rest of the system is not affected. Diagnostic reports are avaiable. No attempt to restore or gracefully deconstruct objects, reclaim resources, etc. This implies that the subsystem (which crashed) and the caller (which called the subsystem) must not share mutable memory (including the memory manager/allocator).
- All other errors are expected and must be handled explicitly.

So how can we provide the convenience of coding only a linear happy-path without exceptions or monads?

TODO: Compare Swift, Zig, Go error handling.

## Computational models

Three important computation models are lambda calculus (as used in Haskell), logic programming (as used in Prolog) and Turing machine (as used in imperative machines).

Let's build a language based on the mechanisms provided by these models.

- Lambda calculus is good at composition. To this it provides 3 devices: variables (free, immutable when bound), abstraction (creating pure functions) and function application.
- Logic programming is good at declaratively describing the intention. It provides statements (meaning assertions) and ways to assemble statements.  
- Turing machine is good at handling state.

So let's use these, as close to their ideal, mathematical forms as possible. How is this different from other languages?

Conditionals and assignments must be based on a Prolog-like interpretation. `if-then` and `assert()`, `static-if` should all be the same fundamental construct. Even type checking: `f(x: int)` is, in essence, `f(x), is_integer(x) :- true.`

Funtions should be based on lambda calculus. Function are pure (modulo the attached environment, does this make sense?) and can be combined like in Haskell.

State must be explicit, not mixed with any other features (like most languages allow passing mutable reference parameters for functions)

### Detailed view of the paradigms

Imperative paradigm can be described with a Turing-machine so it's like a state machine. At each point we look at the current state (and inputs) and select the next state. To manage complex system we hierarchically partition them into substates. Like modules/units -> structures/objects -> variables (and -> bytes and bits on the hardware level).

Functional paradigm can be described with the lambda-calculus. Each function identifies two points, the input and output (state-snapshot). The function provides an algorithm to turn the input into the output. The input and output represents two snapshots along the course of the computation, the output being closer to the desired result. So the function model breaks down the process of the computation into smaller steps.

The logical paradigm describes only the end result as a finished, completed state.

| Paradigm:                  | logical                                         | functional                                                                                       | imperativ                                                                                     |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| partitioning schema        | break down the desired outcome into assertions  | break down the path (process) of computation into smaller steps                                  | break down the state info substates                                                           |
| example                    | UI layout: (space-here is 10, space-there > 8)  | computation graph: f (g A B) (h C D)                                                             | if a == 3 then b = b + 1                                                                      |
| explicit knowledge encoded | full knowledge of the result of the computation | knowledge of going from A to B where A and B are stages of computation for a subset of variables | local decisions without looking forward, just like controlling a variable with the derivative |

The most interesting is how different paradigms break down the problem space.
- logical is by statements about the result
- functional gives computational graph, smaller steps to get from A to B
- imperative by local instructions without any guarantees where are going from and to\

Composition is easy when the new thing we're adding doesn't disturb what we already have.
- logical programming will be easy (provided we have the smart runtime) if we describe the outcome by independent assertions
- function programming will be easy if we can identify the snapshots, the milestones and get closer and closer to the solution by piping the function together
- imperative programming will be easy if we can identify independent substates.

Another observation: the easiest would be the descriptive model, just tell what you want. The drawback is the need for the powerful solver runtime. So the second best is the functional model, tell me where you are, where you want to be and construct the path between them. The imperative model, even if we divide into subspaces, have little perspective, the reasoning is too local, there are no guarantees.

On the other hand, for very small subtasks we can easily apply the logical model. For example, local conditional expressions, very small scoped backtracking.

### The Prolog part

- assignments are unifications. No need to distinguish between let-binding and equality-test
- we might need to explicitly indicate the free variable in every expression. For example, with `>`?

    >x = 3 // x must free variable, so this is a unification. Error if x is bound.
    3 = >x // so this is the same
    x = 3 // equality test, x must be bound. It's an error if x is free

In Prolog the right side of a rule are subgoals, the whole program consists of subgoals. In our case the default is functions. We need an explicit indication that we changed to subgoal-evaluation mode. Let's have a `fail-unless` operator. Candidates: `--`, `†`, `◻`. `□`, `|`.

So instead of

    assert x > 0

we can write

    -- x > 0

And instead of

    if x > 0:
        foo(x)
    else:
        assert x < 0
        bar(x)
    end

    if x > 0:
        foo(x)
    else:
        bar(x)
    end

write

    (-- x > 0:
        foo(x)
    ;-- x < 0:
        bar(x)
    )

    (-- x > 0:
        foo(x)
    ;
        bar(x)
    )

let-binding within conditions is simple:

    (-- >x = try_parse('X'), x ≠ ():
        print "so it's an X"
    ;)

Switch/case:

    case c
    --= 'a': ...
    --= 'b': ...

the special

    case c
     --= pattern1: expr1
    ;--= pattern2: expr2
    end

desugards to

    (-- c = pattern1: expr1
    ;-- c = pattern2: expr2
    )

## Prolog vs monadic vs imperative

Usual pattern:

    a = foo(1)
    if !a return Nothing
    b = bar(a)
    if !b return Nothing
    return baz(b)

The functional way is to use the monadic bind (see Scott Wlaschin's railroad oriented programming). Seems elegant but what really happens is hidden behind the `>>=` operator.
My opinion here is that implementing the platonic idea of the chain/bail-out pattern with monads is mathematically sound but it's just that lambda-calculus is turing complete so of course you can do anything but it's not necessarily the best way.

The Prolog way would be much more explicit:

    (choice-point:
      a = foo(1), // instead of returning Nothing, foo FAILS on error
      b = bar(a), // FAILS on error
      return baz(b)
    ; // prolog-or (else)
      return Nothing // can also fail
    )

or even
    (choice-point:
      return baz(bar(foo(1)))
    ; // prolog-or (else)
      return Nothing // can also fail
    )

The main point of this fail/error handling (see Zig error handling which is a quite nice framework) is that unlike exception-handling, there are no surprise bail-outs. The control flow stays linear, if there's no `goto` written in a line then the next line will be executed, period. Probably, we need to indicate before each expression that if this fails than okay, do this and this (again, see Zig errors).

    (
      ? baz(bar(foo(1) // `?` before expression allows the expression to fail
      ; return Nothing // `;` the prolog-or
    )

How would it look like with backtracking?

    (
      coroutine = enum_urls()
      ? next_url = coroutine()
      ? content = try_download(next_url)
    ;
      print "can't download"
    )

Is this better than streams?

## Syntax

- Define a hard-to-read intermediate language first which describes the semantics. Final, front-end syntax is for later.
- Final syntax could be along the lines of breuleux's thoughts about a less strict LISP-like syntax so we can construct AST without using semantic information.
  http://www.earl-grey.io/
  http://breuleux.net/blog/

Pipeline-style programming should be supported (`v = myarray | square | filter | sum`, not necessarily this syntax).

Probably we should use `(`, `)` only for grouping, no special meaning like tuples. Then we can allow both functional/shell-like function calls:

    f a b c

and parenthesized ones:

    f(a, b, c)

without ambiguity about passing a tuple `(a, b, c)` or 3 arguments.

For tuples, lists, sets, maps, we need something else. This is what we can choose from: `{}` and `[]`.
Also, space separated lists should be supported. Maybe a prefix char before the opening symbol? `a = L[2 4 2]`

Space-sep simple list: `[1 2 3 4 5]`.
List with function calls, so space-sep doesn't work: `[, 1, foo 4, boo 3]`.

How does it look like with curly-braces?

    {1 2 3 4 5}
    {, 1, foo 4, boo 3}

## Container names

The C++'s choice of array/vector/list has no mathematical reason. The original mathematical vector is a 2D or 3D directed line segment pointing out from the origin. This was generalized to any ordered set of values. The important is that the number of values does not change, it's part of the meaning, the structure.

Name     | Size       | Dimensions | Notes
---------|------------|------------|------
list     | may change | 1D only    | general name
array    | may change | primarily 2D, can be anything | might imply indexing
sequence | may change | 1D only    | all items might not available at once
vector   | fixed      | 1D         | 1D-vector means a scalar, that's not what we mean here
matrix   | fixed      | 2D         |
tensor   | fixed      | any        |

- size can be static, bounded dynamic, dynamic
- dimension can be 1, 2, ...
- iterable once, iterable multiple times, bidirectionally iterable multiple times, indexable, contiguous

## Readability

### Coding/decoding

This guy argues that it's easy to write code in any language, even in the bad ones. That's the _forward_ direction. Subsequent maintenance, debugging, frequently performed by a person not knowing the code requires to decode the code, the assumption. That's the backward direction. And that's what differentiates between good and bad languages (besides other things).

Full reference: https://www.quora.com/Which-programming-language-is-was-the-prettiest-and-or-most-readable, paragraph "Let me point out...".

### Simplicity

The complexity of the code should be proportional to the complexity of the task. It's a no-go if it's overly complex to describe a simple idea (like in many languages it's difficult to express that a function returns an int or a string).

## Predictabilty

Reading the code it must be easy to predict what happens next. `if`s make it hard because there are two choices. Virtual dispatch makes it hard, you don't know which concrete method will be called.

## Code and data

Avoid the trap of many popular languages which encourage the code, the logic to be scattered around fragments of state instead of concentrated in single, pure functions.

## Mental model behind the source code to reduce complexity

Organize the code as if the task in hand would be assigned to a bunch of moderately intelligent people. "You put this there, look up that, ask the guy over there where to find that, yell if something's not right, etc...". This approach gives a very graphical, intuitive picture about what's happening.

- Unlike purely functional approach it allows for some mutability but since it's tied to picture that could happen in the real world, the design cannot explode into an overengineered mess.
- It allows a certain level of task-delegation still your main function of the current module/task (the boss) is more-or-less overseeing and controlling the whole thing so tasks distributed over hundreds of nested calls and hidden behind layers of virtual methods are less likely.

## Guarantees

Most of the restrictions checked and enforced at compile time. The goal is to eliminate the need for coding guidelines. E.g. ensuring a MISRA-level strictness should be no more than banning the use of some keywoards and constructs with compiler flags.

Safe constructs should be easy-to-write, they should be the defaults (immutable, thread-safe, memory-safe, no-hidden-expensive-copies) but allow unsafe ones with some extra, explicit code.

Certain constructs must be able to banned at callsite or module level (like no memalloc from this point, no uninitialized memory). Certain high-risk projects (medical, aerospace) need this while others (games) need flexibility at the cost of robustness.

## Types

Q: what's the difference, which one is better, is the second one possible at all?

    Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
    sqrt = fn x -> Maybe float

or

    sqrt = fn x -> float | Nothing

I guess the first one is a sum type (the result of the function), the second one is a union type. Which one should we prefer?

The acrobatics needed to unpack the `Result<T, E>` [here, rust error handling docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html#matching-on-different-errors) suggests that union type with static type flow analysis is the way to go.

That example would look like this:

Instead of `File::open :: string -> Result<File, Error>` we have `File::open :: string -> File or Error`

    match f = File::open("hello.txt")
    | Error ErrorKind::NotFound
        match f2 = File::create("hello.txt")
        | Error _
            panic!("Problem creating the file: {:?}", f2)
    | Error _
        panic!("Problem opening the file: {:?}", f); // f is Error here
    // f is File here

### Type construction

Types can be constructed from other types:

- Struct: product type with named components, same as named tuple
- Tuple: instead of names, indexed with Nats
- Sum: sum type with named components (type constructors)
- Union: sum type with unnamed components which must be unique
- Intersection: product type with unnamed components which must be unique. Can refinement types be encoded with this?

```
A = union-type-of Int Double
let someA = getA
if someA is-of Double
    acceptDouble someA // no need to extract the Double, unlike with Sum types

let someDouble = 2.3
acceptA someDouble // no need to package the Double, unlike with Sum types
```

```
A = intersection-type-of Int Double
let someA = getA
acceptDouble someA // no need to extract the Double, unlike with Product types

let someDouble = 2.3
acceptA (intersection-of someDouble 23) // same as
acceptA (intersection-of 23 someDouble) // because unordered
```

### Logical and physical types

Most function care only about the semantics of the data, even an integer can be stored in very different formats. Typeclasses are a way to handle this. Most of the types in the program should be semantical types (= typeclasses?) with a compiler tracking the possible physical implementations of each variable.

### Co/go-routines

Coroutines and goroutines should be fundamental. Single-channel goroutine with a zero-sized buffer is semantically a coroutine, the  difference is that after a channel operation both goroutines may proceed while with coroutines they're ping-ponging on the same thread. Anyway, they're very similar, should be handled with a similar high-level construct. The same function must be able to be used as a coroutine or goroutine with buffer size 0 or more.

Moreover, the Lobster-like yield/function-call unification follow naturally. That is:

`foo` takes a function `Integer -> ()`:

    foo (f :: Integer -> ()) =
      f 1
      f 2
      f 3

Normal usage:

    foo print

Coroutine usage, the `f` calls in `foo` will act like a yield, or a channel.send operation.

    channel = make_unbuffered_channel(Integer -> ())
    cr = prime_coroute foo channel
    while i = channel.get(), ?i
        print i

Other direction:

    foo (f :: () -> Integer) =
      v = v + f()
      v = v + 2 * f()
      v = v + 3 * f()

Normal usage:

    foo baz

Coroutine usage, the `f` calls if `foo` will act like a channel.get

    channel = make_unbuffered_channel(() -> Integer)
    cr = prime_coroutine foo channel
    channel.put(1)
    channel.put(2)
    channel.put(3)

Setting the channel as buffered we get goroutines.

Even the most simple operations like linear character search in a string must be written in a way so it can be called like a coroutine (think find-all) or goroutine. This decision must be made at callsite. We need to add some syntactic sugar to make this a friendly way.

       index_of seq::T* item::T =
            i := 0
            while c = seq(), ?c
              if c = item
                return i
              end
            end

Btw, this would be interesting, but I'm not sure:

       index_of seq::T* item::T =
            i := 0
            choice_point c = seq()
              if c = item
                return i
              end
              next_choice

The idea is that `choice_point` declares a branching point. `c = seq()` is a unification attempt which can `fail`, as opposed to be `false` or `seq()` returns `Nothing`.
The `next_choice` gets the next possible unification from the choice point, or, when `set()` fails, continues after the choice.
The `fail` event would be something that cannot be stored or returned, it's a purely control flow event. Also, it's not an exception or exceptional event, it's totally normal. It would interesting to consider this error handling instead of returning
`Nothing` in some cases (map.get_value).

- The syntax must be very simple. Nobody wants to write/call a character search with goroutine channel syntax.
- If callsite decides coroutine the whole function will be optimized into an inline for-loop.
- Callsite may need an actual, materialized string, concise redirect-into-array must be possible.

### Extending the concept of mathematical functions with mutable environments.

Functions cannot change their input variables. They can return a value or change something in the which is passed to them. The environment is the only thing where mutation may take place. It also allows functions to see values from enclosing scopes in a controlled way. Environments can be used for the following:

- Providing functions with memory allocators (there's no default, global memory allocator but syntax must provide an implicit way of defining and calling functions as if there were one). If a caller does not explicitly provide a memory allocator for the callee, then the whole call-chain below the callee is guaranteed not to allocate heap-space.
- Permissions to use unlimited, limited or no stack are also things that can be passed in the environment.
- Permission to diverge. If caller does not provide the permission to diverge the callee is compile-time guaranteed to return in bounded time.
- There are no global variables. The local scope of the main function is an environment from where global variables can be passed down to callees. The syntax must allow easy, implicit passing (after an explicit initial permission) so it can be used like a global variable.
- Providing buffers for callee to use for the return value.
- Mutable function arguments.
- IO (like print to console, access to file system)

In unrestricted scope, the usual part of the environment is passed implicitly to callees (memory allocator, IO). In restricted scope everything must be passed explicitly.
Control structures define their own scopes. In those cases, even if the enclosing function is a restricted scope, the inline if-branches, loop-bodies and anonymous functions receive the same context but they don't forward it implicitly to callees.

### Modularity

The default is that a library contains all the necessary information for the caller to create a specialized instantiation of the callee. In situation where a stable ABI is needed to callee can be precompiled, specialized in a permissive way.

TODO: Investigate modularity in other languages, most notably in ML.

## Development Environment

The environment, tools, workflows are more important than the language itself. Areas where the language can help building a productive environment.

- Fast compilation times.
- Ability to run without compiling (interpreted mode), support for REPL-style coding.
- Easy debugging, well-designed debug information, debug builds should run fast. Easily serializable, printable variables (compare how you can explore the program state in Java debugger versus a typical C++ debugger)
- IDE: Easily parsable language, solid language constructs the IDE can explore and follow.

## Features, ideas

- All values, types (also higher-kinded) are handled as sets in a uniform way at compile-time. Common set operations are available to constructs unnamed types (sets) on-the-fly.
- All types are sets of values. There can be values that are elements of multiple types. See next entry.
- Literals have no inherent type: `0` is a value that is element of the set of integers, floats, doubles, etc...
- Type of integer division is a rational number. It still can be an integer if compile-time provable that it's an integer. Otherwise, to coerce it into an integer one must use floor or ceil or round.
- Study [Ada's Steelman Requirements](https://dwheeler.com/steelman/index.html) for ideas.
- Study the [Unison language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCWtkvDQ2ZI) which applies the git-sha idea & AST-serialization for function storage and retrieval. [Unison website](https://www.unisonweb.org/)
- The [Dark language](https://thenewstack.io/dark-a-new-programming-language-for-deployless-deployments/) also has some interesting ideas about how simplify the backend business, from editor to deployment.

### Interchangeable functions, arrays, maps, records

All of these are mappings. Lookup syntax must be similar, a function accepting one of them must accept all of them. There can be big differences in what is known at compile time but that should not be put forward, the general idea is that they are all the same high-level idea, mappings.

operation           | notation  | domain (values of x)   | codomain type (result type)
--------------------|-----------|------------------------|---------------
function application| f(x) -> y | can be a runtime value | same for all x's
map lookup          | m[x] -> y | can be a runtime value | same for all x's
array lookup        | a[x] -> y | can be a runtime value | same for all x's
vector lookup       | v[x] -> y | compile-time fixed     | same for all x's
tuple lookup        | t[x] -> y | compile-time fixed     | depends on x
field of record     | r.x  -> y | compile-time fixed     | depends on x
field selector      | x r  -> y | compile-time fixed     | depends on x

Not that if `x` is a name, it refers to a variable, except with field-of-record, where it's a string: `r.foo` looks up the field `foo` and `foo` is not evaluated as a variable name.
Maybe we can use `.` as a don't-eval prefix and r.x is just a normal function call with `x` as a compile-time string.

Need to think about this: field of record is a binary function: `get-field field-name struct-variable` which can be curried to either e.g. `get-field-foo bar` or to `get-some-field-of-bar foo`. The latter is closer to the usual `r.x` notation while the former is how it's done in functional languages (projection: `first x`). Anyway it would be necessary to have the same, universal syntax for all the cases above.

Back to the table above: so a function accepting a record with have no reason not to accept a map or a function which returns the same information. A function accepting an array also should accept a function instead of the array:

Let v be a vector `[0, 1, 4, 9]`. We can define a function which expresses the same thing:

    f = function x: int
       where 0 <= x < 4
       -> x^2

`f` must be a drop-in replacement for `v`, accepted by all functions accepting `v`.
Another example, box function, with runtime boundaries:

    get_box_function = function lo (int) hi (int) -> (...):
        return function x (int) -> (int):
                   where lo <= x < hi
                   return 1
        end
    end

This is related to type-classes (since an obvious solution is to use some IndexableWithFiniteSupport kind of type class whenever it's like that). Also related to dependent-types since if we have a fixed size vector we'd like to exploit this information in compile-time and prove things. So:

 Q: (1) Use type-classes or (2) extend the function concept with queries about the domain of args or (3) require special types for constrained arguments (like NaturalLessThanX)
 Q: (1) Use Idris-like dependent types or (2) use some hacky way to represent numbers that can have different values in compile-time and runtime and erase that info in run-time if not needed.

Note: Constrained types are possible in Ada (define new type, integer with range 0..10) where this is a runtime check.


Can we make a vector which can indexed by number and field name?
We have product types (tuples) with optionally named fields (structs). Btw is numerical indices ambiguous
(can be both positional or key).
A vector with named fields is a tuple that happens to have the same type for all fields? Or a vector with optionally named values?
Maybe we don't even need to separate vectors and tuples and structs, not even at syntax level.

    a :: Vector2
    i :: Int
    a.0
    a.1
    a.x // same as `a "x"`
    a.y
    a i // do we need something else which binds stronger, at least visually, like a[i]?
    (a i)
    a(i) // also works

### Live Coding

Like this: [Eve-style clock demo in Red, livecoded!](https://www.red-lang.org/2016/07/eve-style-clock-demo-in-red-livecoded.html)

### Example of overhelming options:

Matrix multiplication function. The essence of the function is simple:

    mult = fn x y // mult function takes 2 args
    {
      var z = <some uninitialized type like x and y>
      assert #1 x = #0 y // inner dimensions must be the equal
      map 0 :< #0 x // generate numbers 0 :< height(x), call the next function on them
       \i map 0 :< #1 y // generate numbers 0 :< width(y), call the next function on them
        \j map 0 :< #1 x // generate numbers 0 :< width(x), call the next function on them
         \k x_i_k * y_k_j -> r_i_j // the innermost function initializes r_i_j
      return r
    }

List of all the things which we should be able to specify and customize here:

- `x` and `y` could be any type (maybe different) which can be indexed by two nonneg integers and have finite runtime size.
  Or, the types can be constrained, if necessary.
- The results of the index operations (`x_i_j`, `y_i_j`) must have a `*` binary operator. Or, it can be constrained to any
  such type or type family.
- The type of `z` must be derived from the compile/runtime characteristics of the dimensions of `x` and `y`. That is:
  - If we know the exact sizes in compile time, use fixed-size (like a C++ `array`) for `z`.
  - If sizes of `x` and `y` are bounded in compile time (like an inlined matrix with bounded runtime sizes) then use
    an inlined matrix.
  - Otherwise, use a dynamically allocated matrix. But which one? A compact, column-major one?
  Also, note that in certain cases the sizes of `x` and `y` can be known in compile-time even if they're dynamic matrices
  of functions.
  And the caller must be able to specify a custom return type. And not only that, we must be able to use a pre-allocated
  variable from the caller's environment. This is needed when we'd like to re-use the same memory in a loop, for example.
- For `z`, we must be able not to initialize it (explicitly). Still we should assert or the compiler should check that it's
  initialized at the end. An alternative solution would be to provide an `fn i j` visitor for the constructor.
- The loops must be unrolled for small, compile-time known sizes. Or customized: we should be able to specity when to
  unroll it, possibly dependending on the nature of the input dimensions

## Related literature

This paper is probably double relevant, since it (1) adds purity to an impure language and (2) uses capabilities (= permissions in my language). But I don't understand the paper.
