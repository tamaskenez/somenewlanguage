# SOME NEW PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

## Main design goals

- All-purpose, system language, at the same time equally good as a scripting language.
- Playing around the "what if Stroustrup studied in Edinburgh" idea just like Rust but trade in some discipline for limitations, runtime checks, simplicity.
- Support pure code with explicit state islands, lexical and dynamic scoping.
- Effects are opt-in, explicit.

## Status

Nothing is working, this is a neverending brainstorming for now.
